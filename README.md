# DIY Explorer

## Description 
A full-stack application that allows users to share "do it yourself" crafts, explore other users' content, save DIY ideas for easy reference, and provide and receive feedback on projects.

## User Story
As I user interested in "do it yourself" (DIY) projects, I would like an application that allows me to save my projects, explore ideas, and interact with projects created by other users. When on the homepage, I am presented with a list of DIY projects posted by other users to explore. When I am logged in, I have the option to comment on projects or save them to my profile. When on my profile page, I see a list of saved projects that link me directly to the post, a list of projects I have posted, and a form to create a new project.

## Features
When first visting the homepage, users can explore and view projects. They are also given the option to log in or sign up.
